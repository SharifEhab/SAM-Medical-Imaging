The Medical SAM (Segment Anything Model) repository is a fork of the [original SAM repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) with modifications to support object segmentation in medical imaging using DICOM files. The SAM model is a state-of-the-art object segmentation model that predicts object masks given prompts that indicate the desired object. This implementation uses SAM to efficiently produce high-quality masks from prompts for medical imaging tasks using DICOM files. It allows the user to provide box prompt via the SamPredictor class to predict masks for a given medical DICOM file.

### Demo Notebook ðŸ““

This repository provides a demo notebook demonstrating how to use SAM for medical imaging. The notebook includes:

- **Lung CT**: Examples of segmenting lung structures from CT DICOM files.
- **Axial CBCT View**: Examples of segmenting regions of interest in axial CBCT slices.

#### Screenshots from the Demo:
